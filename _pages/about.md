**Gabriel Alon** 

Data Scientist ðŸ“ˆ and Coffee Enthousiast â˜•

Master of Applied Data Science ðŸŽ“ðŸ“œ

Data Science is my passion and my career path. I am **fascinated** by the power of the tools that data scientists have to discover patterns, predict unknowns, persuade audiences, and create positive changes in the world. I am also motivated by the opportunity to explore new kinds of data and work with talented people.
